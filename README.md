### Hi there 👋 I'm Mark, and im a huge Node.js and Typescript fan! 🎈 My passion is all things Dev-Sec-Ops 🛡️

🔭 I’m currently starting a small software incubator with my partner @Hoyerup. We do all sorts of fun projects!

🌱 I’m currently learning mobile app development, through Ionic as well as Unity game engine. Frontend was always weak point, untill React.js found me!

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of projects. I do freelance, open source and volunteer work, collabarations and tutoring!

💬 So, ask me about all things, i am always eager to help a fellow developer out.
